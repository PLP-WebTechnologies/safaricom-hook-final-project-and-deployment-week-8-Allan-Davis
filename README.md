Design Choices:

I focused on a minimalist design with a mobile-first approach, making sure itâ€™s responsive and looks great on all devices.
Typography was chosen for readability and aesthetic appeal, and interactive elements like buttons have hover effects to engage users.
JavaScript Features:

Form Validation: Ensures users fill out the contact form correctly, preventing errors.
Learn More Button: Directs users to the About page for more details on the site.
Challenges:

Ensuring responsiveness for various screen sizes was a challenge, but using CSS Flexbox and media queries helped manage layout changes efficiently.
Deployment:

The site was deployed on GitHub Pages by pushing the repository to GitHub and enabling GitHub Pages in the settings.
